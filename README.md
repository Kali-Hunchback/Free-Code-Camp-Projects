# Free-Code-Camp-Projects
## **This repository is now defunct, please refer to the individual FCC marked repositories.<br>
The source code is available and the deployments are on GitHub Pages instead of hosted on CodePen**
## A collection of projects undertaken as a part of FreeCodeCamps (FCC) certifications

These projects were undertaken to expand my understanding of web development as well as algorithms, data structures and serving as a basis for learning JavaScript through the use of a structured resource.

### Responsive Web Design Projects

#### Build a Tribute Page
This is the first of the projects in the FCC curriculum. The following user stories were provided to meet a completion of the project

1. My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.

1. I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").

1. I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".

1. Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".

1. Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.

1. I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

1. I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page.

1. The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
1. The img element should be centered within its parent element.

##### Testing
In order for these user stories to be tested, the site was composed on CodePen.io, where a project was forked containing a testing suite to identify the completion of the stories. The testing suite can be accessed by either clicking the three-bar icon in the top left of the page, or using the shortcut CTRL+SHFT+O and run the tests.

#### Build a Survey Form
The second project, user stories are provided below, I took a while between this and the first project, but I learnt a lot while working on this one sporadically over the course of a month.

1. I can see a title with id="title" in H1 sized text.

1. I can see a short explanation with id="description" in P sized text.

1. I can see a form with id="survey-form".

1. Inside the form element, I am required to enter my name in a field with id="name".

1. Inside the form element, I am required to enter an email in a field with id="email".

1. If I enter an email that is not formatted correctly, I will see an HTML5 validation error.

1. Inside the form, I can enter a number in a field with id="number".

1. If I enter non-numbers in the number input, I will see an HTML5 validation error.

1. If I enter numbers outside the range of the number input, which are defined by the min and max attributes, I will see an HTML5 validation error.

1. For the name, email, and number input fields inside the form I can see corresponding labels that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids: id="name-label", id="email-label", and id="number-label".

1. For the name, email, and number input fields, I can see placeholder text that gives me a description or instructions for each field.

1. Inside the form element, I can select an option from a dropdown that has a corresponding id="dropdown".

1. Inside the form element, I can select a field from one or more groups of radio buttons. Each group should be grouped using the name attribute.

1. Inside the form element, I can select several fields from a series of checkboxes, each of which must have a value attribute.

1. Inside the form element, I am presented with a textarea at the end for additional comments.

1. Inside the form element, I am presented with a button with id="submit" to submit all my inputs.

#### Build a Product Landing Page
Third Project, User stories provided below IN PROGRESS

1. My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".

1. I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.

1. Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".

1. I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.

1. When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.

1. I can watch an embedded product video with id="video".

1. My landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form".

1. Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.

1. The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.

1. The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.

1. Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit".

1. When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit).

1. The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.

1. My product landing page should have at least one media query.

1. My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.
