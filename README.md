# Free-Code-Camp-Projects

## A collection of projects undertaken as a part of FreeCodeCamps (FCC) certifications

These projects were undertaken to expand my understanding of web development as well as algorithms, data structures and serving as a basis for learning JavaScript through the use of a structured resource.

### Responsive Web Design Projects

#### Build a Tribute Page
This is the first of the projects in the FCC curriculum. The following user stories were provided to meet a completion of the project

1. My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.

1. I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").

1. I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".

1. Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".

1. Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.

1. I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

1. I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page.

1. The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
1. The img element should be centered within its parent element.

##### Testing
In order for these user stories to be tested, the site was composed on CodePen.io, where a project was forked containing a testing suite to identify the completion of the stories. The testing suite can be accessed by either clicking the three-bar icon in the top left of the page, or using the shortcut CTRL+SHFT+O and run the tests.
